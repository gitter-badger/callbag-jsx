  <h1>How to Install</h1>
</div>

<br>

`callbag-jsx` itself is a small package that can be installed via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/callbag-jsx) 
(or yarn). However, `callbag-jsx` is best used when you code in JSX (which is an extension for JavaScript)
and not in pure JavaScript. For that purpose, you need a transpiler, that is configured to work properly with `callbag-jsx`.
